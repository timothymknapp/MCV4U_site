In this section, weâ€™ll work through example problems that reinforce the concepts of **Cartesian vectors**. These examples cover:
- Writing vectors in component form.
- Adding and subtracting vectors.
- Scalar multiplication.
- Calculating magnitude and direction.

## Example 1: Writing a Vector in Component Form

#### Ex1.
A vector $\vec{v}$ has an $x$-component of $4$ and a $y$-component of $-3$. Write the vector in component form and draw it on the $xy$-plane.

**Solution**:  
The vector in component form is:

$$
\vec{v} = (4, -3).
$$

To draw the vector, start at the origin $(0, 0)$ and draw an arrow to the point $(4, -3)$. The vector points 4 units to the right and 3 units downward.

**Answer**:  
The vector in component form is $ \boxed{\vec{v} = (4, -3)} $.

## Example 2: Adding Two Vectors

#### Ex2.
Two vectors are given:
- $\vec{u} = (3, 2)$,
- $\vec{v} = (-1, 4)$.

Find the resultant vector $\vec{w} = \vec{u} + \vec{v}$.

**Solution**:  
To add two vectors, add their corresponding components:

$$
\vec{w} = \vec{u} + \vec{v} = (u_x + v_x, u_y + v_y).
$$

Substitute the values:

$$
\vec{w} = (3 + (-1), 2 + 4) = (2, 6).
$$

**Answer**:  
The resultant vector is $ \boxed{\vec{w} = (2, 6)} $.

## Example 3: Subtracting Two Vectors

#### Ex3.
Two vectors are given:
- $\vec{a} = (5, -3)$,
- $\vec{b} = (2, 1)$.

Find the vector $\vec{c} = \vec{a} - \vec{b}$.

**Solution**:  
To subtract two vectors, subtract their corresponding components:

$$
\vec{c} = \vec{a} - \vec{b} = (a_x - b_x, a_y - b_y).
$$

Substitute the values:

$$
\vec{c} = (5 - 2, -3 - 1) = (3, -4).
$$

**Answer**:  
The resultant vector is $ \boxed{\vec{c} = (3, -4)} $.

## Example 4: Scalar Multiplication

#### Ex4.
A vector $\vec{v} = (2, -3)$ is scaled by a factor of $k = -2$. Find the new vector.

**Solution**:  
To multiply a vector by a scalar, multiply each component by the scalar:

$$
k\vec{v} = (k v_x, k v_y).
$$

Substitute the values:

$$
k\vec{v} = (-2)(2, -3) = (-4, 6).
$$

**Answer**:  
The new vector is $ \boxed{\vec{v}_{\text{new}} = (-4, 6)} $.

## Example 5: Magnitude and Direction of a Vector

#### Ex5.
A vector $\vec{p} = (3, 4)$ is given. Find its magnitude and direction.

**Solution**:  

1. **Magnitude**:  
   Use the Pythagorean theorem:
   
   $$
   |\vec{p}| = \sqrt{p_x^2 + p_y^2}.
   $$

   Substitute the values:
   
   $$
   |\vec{p}| = \sqrt{(3)^2 + (4)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5.
   $$

2. **Direction**:  
   Use trigonometry to find the angle $\theta$ with the positive $x$-axis:

   $$
   \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{p_y}{p_x}\right).
   $$

   Substitute the values:

   $$
   \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{4}{3}\right) \approx 53.1^\circ.
   $$

**Answer**:  
The magnitude of the vector is $ \boxed{5} $, and its direction is approximately $ \boxed{53.1^\circ} $.
