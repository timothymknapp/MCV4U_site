Welcome to Section 7.1, where we explore **Cartesian vectors** in two dimensions. Cartesian vectors are represented using components along the $x$- and $y$-axes, making them a powerful tool for solving problems in physics, engineering, and computer science. In this section, we’ll introduce the basic notation, learn how to draw and manipulate Cartesian vectors, and explore their properties.

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

### Learning Goal:
Understand the notation and properties of 2D Cartesian vectors. Be able to represent, draw, add, subtract, scale, and find the magnitude and direction of Cartesian vectors.

### Success Criteria:
- Write a vector in component form: $\vec{v} = (v_x, v_y)$.
- Draw a Cartesian vector on the $xy$-plane.
- Add, subtract, and scale Cartesian vectors.
- Calculate the magnitude of a vector using the Pythagorean theorem.
- Determine the direction of a vector using trigonometry.

## Key Idea: Cartesian Vector Notation

A **Cartesian vector** in 2D is written in component form as:

$$
\vec{v} = (v_x, v_y),
$$

where:
- $v_x$ is the $x$-component (horizontal part),
- $v_y$ is the $y$-component (vertical part).

This representation allows us to describe vectors algebraically and perform operations like addition, subtraction, and scaling.

### Visualizing Cartesian Vectors

To visualize a Cartesian vector, we draw it as an arrow starting at the origin $(0, 0)$ and ending at the point $(v_x, v_y)$. The length of the arrow represents the **magnitude**, and the angle it makes with the positive $x$-axis represents the **direction**.

## Operations on Cartesian Vectors

### 1. Adding and Subtracting Vectors
To add or subtract two Cartesian vectors, add or subtract their corresponding components:

$$
\vec{u} + \vec{v} = (u_x + v_x, u_y + v_y),
$$

$$
\vec{u} - \vec{v} = (u_x - v_x, u_y - v_y).
$$

### 2. Scalar Multiplication
To multiply a vector by a scalar $k$, multiply each component by $k$:

$$
k\vec{v} = (k v_x, k v_y).
$$

### 3. Magnitude of a Vector
The magnitude of a vector is the length of the arrow and is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:

$$
|\vec{v}| = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2}.
$$

### 4. Direction of a Vector
The direction of a vector is the angle $\theta$ it makes with the positive $x$-axis, measured counterclockwise. It is calculated using trigonometry:

$$
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{v_y}{v_x}\right).
$$

### Why Are Cartesian Vectors Useful?

Cartesian vectors allow us to:
- Represent vectors algebraically, making calculations easier.
- Combine multiple forces, velocities, or displacements into a single resultant vector.
- Analyze motion, forces, and other physical phenomena in 2D space.

By mastering Cartesian vectors, you’ll gain a powerful tool for solving real-world problems in physics, engineering, and beyond.
