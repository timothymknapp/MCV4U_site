Welcome to **Unit 7**, where we dive into the world of **Cartesian vectors**! Cartesian vectors are a powerful tool for representing and manipulating vectors algebraically. They allow us to work with vectors in a coordinate system, making calculations more systematic and versatile.

### Success Criteria:
- Represent vectors in Cartesian form: $\vec{v} = (v_x, v_y)$.
- Perform operations such as addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication on Cartesian vectors.
- Calculate the magnitude and direction of a Cartesian vector.
- Understand the relationship between Cartesian vectors and geometric vectors.

## Key Idea: Cartesian Vectors

A **Cartesian vector** is a vector represented using components along the $x$- and $y$-axes (and later, the $z$-axis in 3D). In two dimensions, a Cartesian vector is written as:
$$
\vec{v} = (v_x, v_y),
$$
where:
- $v_x$ is the $x$-component (horizontal part),
- $v_y$ is the $y$-component (vertical part).

This representation allows us to describe vectors algebraically and perform operations like addition, subtraction, and scaling with ease.

### Why Are Cartesian Vectors Versatile?

Cartesian vectors are incredibly versatile because they can be extended to multiple dimensions:
- In **2D**, vectors are represented as $(v_x, v_y)$.
- In **3D**, vectors are represented as $(v_x, v_y, v_z)$.
- In higher dimensions (used in advanced mathematics and computer science), vectors can have even more components.

This flexibility makes Cartesian vectors indispensable in fields like physics, engineering, computer graphics, and machine learning.

### Cartesian vs. Geometric Vectors

In the previous unit, we worked with **geometric vectors**, which are defined by their magnitude and direction. These vectors are still valid and useful, especially in 2D scenarios where the magnitude and direction are given.

However, Cartesian vectors provide an **algebraic alternative** that simplifies calculations:
- Instead of relying on trigonometry to resolve vectors into components, we can directly use their $x$- and $y$-components.
- Operations like addition, subtraction, and scaling become straightforward arithmetic.

For example:
- A geometric vector with a magnitude of $5$ and a direction of $30^\circ$ can be converted into its Cartesian form:
  $$
  \vec{v} = (5\cos(30^\circ), 5\sin(30^\circ)) \approx (4.33, 2.5).
  $$

This conversion bridges the gap between geometric and Cartesian representations, allowing us to use the best tool for the job.

### Applications of Cartesian Vectors

Cartesian vectors are widely used in various fields:
- **Physics**: Analyzing forces, velocities, and accelerations in multiple dimensions.
- **Engineering**: Designing structures, analyzing stresses, and optimizing systems.
- **Computer Graphics**: Simulating realistic motion, lighting, and shading.
- **Machine Learning**: Representing data points and performing operations like projections and similarity calculations.

By mastering Cartesian vectors, youâ€™ll gain a powerful tool for solving real-world problems in science, engineering, and beyond.
