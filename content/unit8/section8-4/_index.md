In this section, we delve into the process of creating equations for lines and planes in three-dimensional (3D) space. Understanding how to construct these equations is fundamental for solving geometric problems, analyzing spatial relationships, and modeling real-world scenarios.

#### Why Study This Topic?

Lines and planes are the building blocks of geometry in 3D space. By learning how to create their equations, you’ll gain the ability to:
- Describe paths, trajectories, or boundaries in 3D environments.
- Model surfaces and structures, such as walls, floors, or mechanical components.
- Solve systems of equations to determine intersections, distances, and orientations.

These skills are essential in fields like engineering, computer graphics, physics, and architecture, where precise spatial calculations are critical.

#### Key Concepts Covered in This Section:

1. **Creating Equations of Lines in 3D**:
   - Use a point on the line and a direction vector to write the **vector equation**:
     $$
     \vec{r}(t) = \vec{r}_0 + t\vec{m},
     $$
     where $\vec{r}_0$ is a position vector to a point on the line, $\vec{m}$ is a direction vector, and $t$ is a scalar parameter.
   - Convert the vector equation into **parametric form** for practical applications.

2. **Creating Equations of Planes in 3D**:
   - Use a point on the plane and two direction vectors to write the **vector equation**:
     $$
     \vec{r}(s, t) = \vec{r}_0 + s\vec{u} + t\vec{v},
     $$
     where $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ are direction vectors parallel to the plane, and $s$ and $t$ are scalar parameters.
   - Alternatively, use a normal vector $\vec{n}$ and a point on the plane to write the **scalar equation**:
     $$
     ax + by + cz + d = 0.
     $$

3. **Special Cases**:
   - Construct lines that are **parallel** to a given plane.
   - Construct planes that are **perpendicular** to a given line.
   - Find intercepts of planes with the coordinate axes.

#### Applications of These Concepts:
Understanding how to create equations of lines and planes has numerous real-world applications:
- **Engineering**: Designing structures, analyzing forces, and optimizing systems.
- **Computer Graphics**: Rendering realistic 3D models and simulating motion.
- **Physics**: Modeling trajectories, collisions, and interactions between objects.
- **Navigation**: Planning efficient routes in air, sea, or space travel.

By mastering these techniques, you’ll develop the tools needed to analyze and solve complex spatial problems.
