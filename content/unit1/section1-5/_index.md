## Understanding Continuity

Continuity is a fundamental concept in calculus that describes whether a function behaves "smoothly" without breaks, jumps, or holes. In this section, we will define continuity, explore graphical continuities and discontinuities, and apply the definition of continuity to analyze functions.

### Definition of Continuity

A function \( f(x) \) is **continuous** at a point \( x = c \) if all three of the following conditions are satisfied:

1. **The function is defined at \( x = c \):** \( f(c) \) exists.
2. **The limit exists at \( x = c \):** \( \lim_{{x \to c}} f(x) \) exists.
3. **The function value equals the limit:** \( \lim_{{x \to c}} f(x) = f(c) \).

If any of these conditions fail, the function is discontinuous at \( x = c \).

### Graphical Continuities and Discontinuities

Continuity can often be visualized graphically. Below are common types of discontinuities:

1. **Point Discontinuity (Removable):**
   - A hole in the graph at \( x = c \) where the limit exists, but \( f(c) \) is undefined or does not equal the limit.

2. **Jump Discontinuity:**
   - A "jump" in the graph where the left-hand and right-hand limits exist but are not equal.

3. **Infinite Discontinuity:**
   - A vertical asymptote at \( x = c \), where the function grows arbitrarily large or small.

Note the three types of Discontinuity on the below graphs.

### Summary of Key Concepts

- A function is continuous at \( x = c \) if it meets three conditions: defined at \( c \), the limit exists at \( c \), and the limit equals the function value.
- Graphical discontinuities include point, jump, and infinite discontinuities.
