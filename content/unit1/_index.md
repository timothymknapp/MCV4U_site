## Unit: Rates of Change

### Overview
In this unit, students will explore the concepts of average and instantaneous rates of change, laying the groundwork for understanding the derivative. These concepts are pivotal in calculus, helping students analyze how quantities change and how to model real-world phenomena.

### Average Rate of Change
The average rate of change of a function over an interval gives us a measure of how the function's output values change, on average, over that interval. It can be thought of as the slope of the secant line connecting two points on the graph of the function.

- **Formula**: 
  $$\text{Average Rate of Change} = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}$$
  where \( f(a) \) and \( f(b) \) are the function values at points \( a \) and \( b \), respectively.

### Instantaneous Rate of Change
The instantaneous rate of change at a point gives us a precise measure of how the function's output is changing at that specific point. This concept introduces us to the derivative, which represents the slope of the tangent line to the function's graph at a given point.

- **Derivative**: 
  The derivative of a function \( f \) at a point \( x = a \) is given by:
  $$f'(a) = \lim_{{h \to 0}} \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}$$
  This limit, if it exists, defines the derivative \( f'(x) \) and represents the instantaneous rate of change at \( x = a \).

### Differentiability and Continuity
For a function to have a derivative (i.e., be differentiable) at a point, it must be continuous at that point. This unit will delve into the connection between differentiability and continuity:

- **Continuity**: A function is continuous at a point \( x = a \) if:
  $$\lim_{{x \to a}} f(x) = f(a)$$
- **Differentiability**: A function is differentiable at a point \( x = a \) if:
  - It is continuous at \( x = a \).
  - The limit defining the derivative exists.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this unit, students will:
1. Understand and compute average rates of change over given intervals.
2. Grasp the concept of the instantaneous rate of change and learn how to calculate derivatives.
3. Recognize the relationship between differentiability and continuity.
