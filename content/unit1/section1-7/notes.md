### Example 1: Find the Equation of the Tangent Line

Find the equation of the tangent line to the function \( f(x) = x^3 - 2x + 1 \) at \( x = 2 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the Derivative:**
   - \( f'(x) = 3x^2 - 2 \)
   - At \( x = 2 \), \( f'(2) = 3(2)^2 - 2 = 10 \)

2. **Identify the Point:**
   - The point of tangency is \( (2, f(2)) \). 
   - \( f(2) = (2)^3 - 2(2) + 1 = 5 \)

3. **Use the Point-Slope Form:**
   - Substitute \( m = 10 \) and \( (2, 5) \) into the point-slope form:
     

\[
     y - 5 = 10(x - 2)
     \]


   - Simplifying, we get:
     

\[
     y = 10x - 15
     \]



**Conclusion:**
The equation of the tangent line to \( f(x) = x^3 - 2x + 1 \) at \( x = 2 \) is \( y = 10x - 15 \).

### Example 2: Find the Slope of the Tangent Line

Find the slope of the tangent line to the function \( g(x) = \frac{1}{x} \) at \( x = \frac{1}{2} \).

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the Derivative:**
   - \( g'(x) = - \frac{1}{x^2} \)
   - At \( x = \frac{1}{2} \), \( g'\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = - \frac{1}{ { \left( \frac {1}{2} \right) }^2} = 4 \)


**Conclusion:**
The slope of the tangent line to \( g(x) = \frac{1}{x}\) at \( x = \frac{1}{2} \) is \( 4 \).

### Example 3: Find the Point Where the Tangent is -1

Find the point on the function \( h(x) = x^2 - 3x + 2 \) where the slope of the tangent line is -1.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the Derivative:**
   - \( h'(x) = 2x - 3 \)
   - Set the derivative equal to -1:
     

\[
     2x - 3 = -1
     \]


   - Solve for \( x \):
     

\[
     2x = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 1
     \]



2. **Find the Corresponding \( y \)-Value:**
   - \( h(1) = (1)^2 - 3(1) + 2 = 0 \)
   - The point is \( (1, 0) \)

**Conclusion:**
The point on \( h(x) = x^2 - 3x + 2 \) where the slope of the tangent line is -1 is \( (1, 0) \).
