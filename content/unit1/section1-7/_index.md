## Introduction to Tangent Lines

A **tangent line** to a function at a given point is a straight line that touches the function's graph at that point and has the same slope as the function at that point. The concept of tangent lines is fundamental in calculus as it connects the idea of derivatives with geometric interpretation.  You can literally see the on the graph that the solpe of the tangent line represents the IROC or the value of the derivative at the tangent point.

### Tangent Lines and Point-Slope Form

The **point-slope form** of a linear equation is given by:


\[
y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)
\]


where \( m \) is the slope of the line, and \((x_1, y_1)\) is a specific point on the line.

### Finding the Tangent Line

To find the equation of the tangent line to the function \( f(x) \) at a point \( x = a \):

1. **Calculate the Slope (Derivative):**
   - The slope of the tangent line at \( x = a \) is given by the derivative of the function at that point:
     

\[
     m = f'(a)
     \]



2. **Identify the Point:**
   - The point of tangency is \( (a, f(a)) \).

3. **Use the Point-Slope Form:**
   - Substitute the slope \( m = f'(a) \) and the point \( (a, f(a)) \) into the point-slope form equation:
     

\[
     y - f(a) = f'(a)(x - a)
     \]



### Example

Consider the function \( f(x) = x^2 \). To find the tangent line at \( x = 1 \):

1. **Calculate the Derivative:**
   - \( f'(x) = 2x \)
   - So, \( f'(1) = 2 \)

2. **Identify the Point:**
   - The point of tangency is \( (1, 1) \) since \( f(1) = 1^2 = 1 \).

3. **Use the Point-Slope Form:**
   - Substitute \( m = 2 \) and \( (1, 1) \) into the point-slope form:
     

\[
     y - 1 = 2(x - 1)
     \]


   - Simplifying, we get:
     

\[
     y = 2x - 1
     \]



The equation of the tangent line to \( f(x) = x^2 \) at \( x = 1 \) is \( y = 2x - 1 \).
