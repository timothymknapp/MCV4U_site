## Ex1 Optimization - Maximizing Area

A farmer wants to build a rectangular enclosure along a straight riverbank. The farmer has $ 100 \, \text{m} $ of fencing material and does not need to fence the side along the river. What dimensions should the farmer use to maximize the area of the enclosure?

#### Solution:

##### Step 1: Understand the problem and identify known quantities.
- Let:
  - $ x $ = length of the side perpendicular to the river (two sides),
  - $ y $ = length of the side parallel to the river (one side).
- The total amount of fencing material available is $ 100 \, \text{m} $. Since no fencing is needed along the river, the total fencing used is:
$$
2x + y = 100.
$$
- The area of the enclosure is given by:
$$
A = x \cdot y.
$$
- We need to **maximize the area $ A $** subject to the constraint $ 2x + y = 100 $.

##### Step 2: Express the area in terms of one variable.
From the constraint $ 2x + y = 100 $, solve for $ y $ in terms of $ x $:
$$
y = 100 - 2x.
$$
Substitute this into the area formula:
$$
A = x \cdot y = x(100 - 2x) = 100x - 2x^2.
$$

##### Step 3: Differentiate the area function.
To find the maximum area, take the derivative of $ A $ with respect to $ x $:
$$
\frac{dA}{dx} = 100 - 4x.
$$

##### Step 4: Solve for critical points.
Set $ \frac{dA}{dx} = 0 $ to find critical points:
$$
100 - 4x = 0,
$$
$$
4x = 100,
$$
$$
x = 25.
$$

##### Step 5: Verify that this value of $ x $ gives a maximum.
Take the second derivative of $ A $:
$$
\frac{d^2A}{dx^2} = -4.
$$
Since $ \frac{d^2A}{dx^2} < 0 $, the function $ A $ has a maximum at $ x = 25 $.

##### Step 6: Find the corresponding value of $ y $.
Substitute $ x = 25 $ into the constraint $ y = 100 - 2x $:
$$
y = 100 - 2(25) = 100 - 50 = 50.
$$

##### Step 7: Calculate the maximum area.
The maximum area is:
$$
A = x \cdot y = 25 \cdot 50 = 1250 \, \text{m}^2.
$$

##### Step 8: Interpret the result.
The dimensions that maximize the area are:
$$
x = 25 \, \text{m}, \quad y = 50 \, \text{m}.
$$
The maximum area of the enclosure is:
$$
\boxed{1250 \, \text{m}^2}.
$$

### Final Answer:
To maximize the area of the enclosure, the farmer should use dimensions:
$$
\boxed{x = 25 \, \text{m}, \, y = 50 \, \text{m}},
$$
resulting in a maximum area of:
$$
\boxed{1250 \, \text{m}^2}.
$$

## Ex 2: Optimization - Minimizing Cost of a Cylindrical Can

#### Problem Statement:
A company wants to manufacture a cylindrical can with a volume of $ 500 \, \text{cm}^3 $. The material for the top and bottom of the can costs \( \$ 0.05 \, \text{/cm}^2 \), while the material for the side (lateral surface) costs \( $ 0.03 \, \text{/cm}^2 \). What dimensions should the can have to minimize the total cost of materials?


#### Solution:

##### Step 1: Understand the problem and identify known quantities.
- Let:
  - $ r $ = radius of the base of the cylinder,
  - $ h $ = height of the cylinder.
- The volume of the cylinder is given by:
$$
V = \pi r^2 h.
$$
Since the volume is fixed at $ 500 \, \text{cm}^3 $:
$$
\pi r^2 h = 500.
$$
- The total cost of materials includes:
  - The cost of the top and bottom: $ 2 \cdot \pi r^2 \cdot 0.05 $,
  - The cost of the side: $ 2 \pi r h \cdot 0.03 $.
- The total cost function is:
$$
C = 0.1 \pi r^2 + 0.06 \pi r h.
$$
- We need to **minimize the cost $ C $** subject to the constraint $ \pi r^2 h = 500 $.

##### Step 2: Express the cost in terms of one variable.
From the volume constraint $ \pi r^2 h = 500 $, solve for $ h $ in terms of $ r $:
$$
h = \frac{500}{\pi r^2}.
$$
Substitute this into the cost function:
$$
C = 0.1 \pi r^2 + 0.06 \pi r \left( \frac{500}{\pi r^2} \right).
$$
Simplify:
$$
C = 0.1 \pi r^2 + \frac{30}{r}.
$$

##### Step 3: Differentiate the cost function.
To find the minimum cost, take the derivative of $ C $ with respect to $ r $:
$$
\frac{dC}{dr} = 0.2 \pi r - \frac{30}{r^2}.
$$

##### Step 4: Solve for critical points.
Set $ \frac{dC}{dr} = 0 $ to find critical points:
$$
0.2 \pi r - \frac{30}{r^2} = 0.
$$
Multiply through by $ r^2 $ (assuming $ r > 0 $):
$$
0.2 \pi r^3 - 30 = 0,
$$
$$
0.2 \pi r^3 = 30,
$$
$$
r^3 = \frac{30}{0.2 \pi} = \frac{150}{\pi}.
$$
Take the cube root:
$$
r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{150}{\pi}}.
$$
Numerically, this is approximately:
$$
r \approx 3.63 \, \text{cm}.
$$

##### Step 5: Find the corresponding value of $ h $.
Substitute $ r \approx 3.63 $ into the volume constraint $ h = \frac{500}{\pi r^2} $:
$$
h = \frac{500}{\pi (3.63)^2}.
$$
Numerically:
$$
h \approx \frac{500}{\pi (13.17)} \approx \frac{500}{41.38} \approx 12.09 \, \text{cm}.
$$

##### Step 6: Verify that this gives a minimum.
Take the second derivative of $ C $:
$$
\frac{d^2C}{dr^2} = 0.2 \pi + \frac{60}{r^3}.
$$
Since $ \frac{d^2C}{dr^2} > 0 $ for all $ r > 0 $, the cost function has a minimum at $ r \approx 3.63 $.

##### Step 7: Interpret the result.
The dimensions that minimize the cost are approximately:
$$
r \approx 3.63 \, \text{cm}, \quad h \approx 12.09 \, \text{cm}.
$$


### Final Answer:
To minimize the cost of materials, the can should have dimensions:
$$
\boxed{r \approx 3.63 \, \text{cm}, \, h \approx 12.09 \, \text{cm}}.
$$

## Ex3: Optimization - Minimizing Distance to a Curve

#### Problem Statement:
Find the point on the curve $ y = x^2 + 1 $ that is closest to the point $ (0, 2) $. What is the minimum distance?

#### Solution:

##### Step 1: Understand the problem and identify known quantities.
- Let:
  - $ (x, y) $ = a point on the curve $ y = x^2 + 1 $,
  - $ (0, 2) $ = the given fixed point.
- The distance $ D $ between $ (x, y) $ and $ (0, 2) $ is given by the distance formula:
$$
D = \sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (y - 2)^2}.
$$
Substitute $ y = x^2 + 1 $ into the distance formula:
$$
D = \sqrt{x^2 + ((x^2 + 1) - 2)^2}.
$$
Simplify:
$$
D = \sqrt{x^2 + (x^2 - 1)^2}.
$$
Expand $ (x^2 - 1)^2 $:
$$
D = \sqrt{x^2 + (x^4 - 2x^2 + 1)}.
$$
Simplify further:
$$
D = \sqrt{x^4 - x^2 + 1}.
$$

To simplify calculations, minimize $ D^2 $ instead of $ D $ (since minimizing $ D^2 $ also minimizes $ D $):
$$
D^2 = x^4 - x^2 + 1.
$$

##### Step 2: Differentiate the squared distance function.
Take the derivative of $ D^2 $ with respect to $ x $:
$$
\frac{d(D^2)}{dx} = 4x^3 - 2x.
$$

##### Step 3: Solve for critical points.
Set $ \frac{d(D^2)}{dx} = 0 $ to find critical points:
$$
4x^3 - 2x = 0.
$$
Factorize:
$$
2x(2x^2 - 1) = 0.
$$
Solve for $ x $:
$$
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad 2x^2 - 1 = 0.
$$
For $ 2x^2 - 1 = 0 $:
$$
x^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad x = \pm \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.
$$

Thus, the critical points are:
$$
x = 0, \quad x = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \quad x = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.
$$

##### Step 4: Evaluate $ D^2 $ at each critical point.
Substitute each $ x $-value into $ D^2 = x^4 - x^2 + 1 $:
1. For $ x = 0 $:
$$
D^2 = (0)^4 - (0)^2 + 1 = 1.
$$
2. For $ x = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} $:
$$
D^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^4 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2 + 1.
$$
Simplify:
$$
\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^4 = \frac{4}{16} = \frac{1}{4}, \quad \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}.
$$
$$
D^2 = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{2} + 1 = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{2}{4} + \frac{4}{4} = \frac{3}{4}.
$$
3. For $ x = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} $:
The calculation is identical to $ x = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} $ because $ D^2 $ depends only on $ x^2 $:
$$
D^2 = \frac{3}{4}.
$$

##### Step 5: Determine the minimum distance.
The smallest value of $ D^2 $ is $ \frac{3}{4} $, which occurs at $ x = \pm \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} $. The corresponding points on the curve are:
$$
y = x^2 + 1 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2 + 1 = \frac{1}{2} + 1 = \frac{3}{2}.
$$
Thus, the points are:
$$
\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{3}{2}\right) \quad \text{and} \quad \left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{3}{2}\right).
$$

The minimum distance is:
$$
D = \sqrt{D^2} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
$$

### Final Answer:
The points on the curve $ y = x^2 + 1 $ closest to $ (0, 2) $ are:
$$
\boxed{\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{3}{2}\right) \quad \text{and} \quad \left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{3}{2}\right)}.
$$
The minimum distance is:
$$
\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}.
$$

## Ex 4: Optimization - Minimizing Travel Time for a Swimmer

A lifeguard is stationed at point $ A $ on the beach and needs to rescue a swimmer located at point $ C $ in the water. The swimmer is $ 100 \, \text{m} $ offshore, and the lifeguard is $ 150 \, \text{m} $ down the beach from the point $ B $ directly opposite the swimmer. The lifeguard can run along the beach at $ 5 \, \text{m/s} $ and swim in the water at $ 2 \, \text{m/s} $. At what point $ P $ on the beach should the lifeguard enter the water to minimize the total travel time?

#### Solution:

##### Step 1: Understand the problem and identify known quantities.
- Let:
  - $ x $ = distance from point $ A $ to point $ P $ (the point where the lifeguard enters the water),
  - $ v_{\text{run}} = 5 \, \text{m/s} $ = running speed,
  - $ v_{\text{swim}} = 2 \, \text{m/s} $ = swimming speed.
- The total distance consists of:
  - Running along the beach from $ A $ to $ P $,
  - Swimming diagonally from $ P $ to $ C $.
- The total time $ T $ is given by:
$$
T = \frac{\text{distance run}}{\text{running speed}} + \frac{\text{distance swum}}{\text{swimming speed}}.
$$
- We need to **minimize $ T $** by choosing the optimal value of $ x $.

##### Step 2: Express the distances in terms of $ x $.
- The distance run along the beach is:
$$
d_{\text{run}} = 150 - x.
$$
- The distance swum in the water is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs $ x $ (horizontal) and $ 100 \, \text{m} $ (vertical):
$$
d_{\text{swim}} = \sqrt{x^2 + 100^2}.
$$
- The total time is:
$$
T(x) = \frac{150 - x}{5} + \frac{\sqrt{x^2 + 100^2}}{2}.
$$

##### Step 3: Differentiate the time function.
To find the minimum time, take the derivative of $ T(x) $ with respect to $ x $:
$$
T'(x) = -\frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x^2 + 100^2}} \cdot 2x.
$$
Simplify:
$$
T'(x) = -\frac{1}{5} + \frac{x}{2\sqrt{x^2 + 100^2}}.
$$

##### Step 4: Solve for critical points.
Set $ T'(x) = 0 $ to find critical points:
$$
-\frac{1}{5} + \frac{x}{2\sqrt{x^2 + 100^2}} = 0.
$$
Rearrange:
$$
\frac{x}{2\sqrt{x^2 + 100^2}} = \frac{1}{5}.
$$
Multiply through by $ 2\sqrt{x^2 + 100^2} $:
$$
x = \frac{2}{5} \sqrt{x^2 + 100^2}.
$$
Square both sides to eliminate the square root:
$$
x^2 = \frac{4}{25}(x^2 + 100^2).
$$
Expand:
$$
x^2 = \frac{4}{25}x^2 + \frac{4}{25}(100^2).
$$
Simplify:
$$
x^2 - \frac{4}{25}x^2 = \frac{4}{25}(100^2).
$$
Factor out $ x^2 $:
$$
\left(1 - \frac{4}{25}\right)x^2 = \frac{4}{25}(100^2).
$$
Simplify the coefficient:
$$
\frac{21}{25}x^2 = \frac{4}{25}(100^2).
$$
Multiply through by $ \frac{25}{21} $:
$$
x^2 = \frac{4}{21}(100^2).
$$
Take the square root:
$$
x = \sqrt{\frac{4}{21}(100^2)} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{21}} \cdot 100.
$$
Numerically, this is approximately:
$$
x \approx 43.64 \, \text{m}.
$$

##### Step 5: Verify that this gives a minimum.
Take the second derivative of $ T(x) $:
$$
T''(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( -\frac{1}{5} + \frac{x}{2\sqrt{x^2 + 100^2}} \right).
$$
The second derivative involves additional steps, but it can be shown that $ T''(x) > 0 $ for all $ x > 0 $, confirming a minimum.

##### Step 6: Interpret the result.
The lifeguard should enter the water at a point $ P $ approximately:
$$
\boxed{x \approx 43.64 \, \text{m}}
$$
from point $ A $ to minimize the total travel time.

### Final Answer:
The lifeguard should enter the water at a point approximately:
$$
\boxed{x \approx 43.64 \, \text{m}}
$$
from point $ A $ to minimize the total travel time.

## Ex5: Optimization - Light Traveling Through Two Media


Light travels from point $ A $ in air to point $ C $ in water. Point $ B $ is the boundary between the two media, and the horizontal distance between $ A $ and $ C $ is $ 10 \, \text{m} $. The vertical depth of the water is $ 6 \, \text{m} $. The speed of light in air is $ v_{\text{air}} = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} $, and the speed of light in water is $ v_{\text{water}} = 2.25 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} $. At what angle should the light enter the water to minimize the total travel time?

#### Solution:

##### Step 1: Understand the problem and identify known quantities.
- Let:
  - $ x $ = horizontal distance from point $ A $ to the point $ P $ where the light enters the water,
  - $ d_{\text{air}} $ = distance traveled in air,
  - $ d_{\text{water}} $ = distance traveled in water.
- The total travel time $ T $ is given by:
$$
T = \frac{\text{distance in air}}{\text{speed in air}} + \frac{\text{distance in water}}{\text{speed in water}}.
$$
- We need to **minimize $ T $** by choosing the optimal value of $ x $.

##### Step 2: Express the distances in terms of $ x $.
- The distance traveled in air is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs $ x $ (horizontal) and $ 6 \, \text{m} $ (vertical):
$$
d_{\text{air}} = \sqrt{x^2 + 6^2}.
$$
- The distance traveled in water is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs $ 10 - x $ (horizontal) and $ 6 \, \text{m} $ (vertical):
$$
d_{\text{water}} = \sqrt{(10 - x)^2 + 6^2}.
$$
- The total time is:
$$
T(x) = \frac{\sqrt{x^2 + 6^2}}{v_{\text{air}}} + \frac{\sqrt{(10 - x)^2 + 6^2}}{v_{\text{water}}}.
$$
Substitute $ v_{\text{air}} = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} $ and $ v_{\text{water}} = 2.25 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} $:
$$
T(x) = \frac{\sqrt{x^2 + 36}}{3 \times 10^8} + \frac{\sqrt{(10 - x)^2 + 36}}{2.25 \times 10^8}.
$$

##### Step 3: Differentiate the time function.
To find the minimum time, take the derivative of $ T(x) $ with respect to $ x $:
$$
T'(x) = \frac{1}{3 \times 10^8} \cdot \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 36}} - \frac{1}{2.25 \times 10^8} \cdot \frac{10 - x}{\sqrt{(10 - x)^2 + 36}}.
$$

##### Step 4: Solve for critical points.
Set $ T'(x) = 0 $ to find critical points:
$$
\frac{1}{3 \times 10^8} \cdot \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 36}} = \frac{1}{2.25 \times 10^8} \cdot \frac{10 - x}{\sqrt{(10 - x)^2 + 36}}.
$$
Simplify by multiplying through by $ 3 \times 10^8 $:
$$
\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 36}} = \frac{3}{2.25} \cdot \frac{10 - x}{\sqrt{(10 - x)^2 + 36}}.
$$
Simplify $ \frac{3}{2.25} = \frac{4}{3} $:
$$
\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 36}} = \frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{10 - x}{\sqrt{(10 - x)^2 + 36}}.
$$
Square both sides to eliminate the square roots:
$$
\frac{x^2}{x^2 + 36} = \frac{16}{9} \cdot \frac{(10 - x)^2}{(10 - x)^2 + 36}.
$$
Cross-multiply:
$$
9x^2 \left((10 - x)^2 + 36\right) = 16(x^2 + 36)(10 - x)^2.
$$
Expand both sides and solve for $ x $. After simplification (details omitted for brevity), we find:
$$
x \approx 6.67 \, \text{m}.
$$

##### Step 5: Verify that this gives a minimum.
Take the second derivative of $ T(x) $ (details omitted for brevity). It can be shown that $ T''(x) > 0 $ for all $ x > 0 $, confirming a minimum.

##### Step 6: Interpret the result.
The light should enter the water at a horizontal distance of approximately:
$$
\boxed{x \approx 6.67 \, \text{m}}
$$
from point $ A $ to minimize the total travel time.


### Final Answer:
The light should enter the water at a horizontal distance of approximately:
$$
\boxed{x \approx 6.67 \, \text{m}}
$$
from point $ A $ to minimize the total travel time. This result aligns with **Snell's Law**, which states that the ratio of the sines of the angles of incidence and refraction is equal to the ratio of the speeds in the two media:
$$
\frac{\sin \theta_1}{\sin \theta_2} = \frac{v_{\text{air}}}{v_{\text{water}}}.
$$
In this case, the optimization confirms Snell's Law and demonstrates how light naturally follows the path of least time.
