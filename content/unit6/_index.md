Welcome to **Unit 6: Geometric Vectors**. In this unit, we'll explore how vectors are used to describe quantities that have both **magnitude** and **direction**, and how we can represent, combine, and analyze them geometrically.

Vectors are essential tools in physics, engineering, and mathematics. You'll learn how to **visualize** vector operations and apply them to solve real-world problems involving motion, forces, and more.

### In this unit, we will cover:

- üß≠ **Vector Basics**  
  What is a vector? How do we represent vectors with arrows and describe them using direction and magnitude?

- ‚ûï **Vector Addition**  
  How to combine vectors using the **head-to-tail** method. We'll look at three cases:  
  - Parallel vectors  
  - Perpendicular vectors  
  - Oblique (angled) vectors

- üî¢ **Scalar Multiplication**  
  How multiplying a vector by a number changes its length and (possibly) its direction.

- ‚ö™ **The Dot Product (Geometric)**  
  How the dot product of two vectors gives insight into how aligned they are. We'll define it geometrically as:  
 
  \[
  \vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = |\vec{a}| |\vec{b}| \cos(\theta)
  \]  
 
  We'll explore the meaning of this formula and what it tells us.

- ‚úñÔ∏è **The Cross Product (Geometric)**  
  A way to compute a vector that is perpendicular to two given vectors. We'll use it to find **areas** and understand **rotational effects**.

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Applications of Vectors**  
  A summary section where we apply vector addition, scalar multiplication, the dot product, and the cross product to real-world examples like:  
  - Displacement  
  - Work  
  - Torque  
  - Vector projection
