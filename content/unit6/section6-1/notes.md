In this section, we’ll work through a series of example problems that reinforce the concepts introduced in Section 6.1. These examples will cover:
- Differentiating between scalars and vectors.
- Drawing vectors based on given descriptions.
- Determining directions using bearings.
- Converting between quadrant and true bearings into calculator-friendly trigonometric bearings.

## Example 1: Differentiating Between Scalars and Vectors

**Question**: Identify whether each of the following quantities is a scalar or a vector:
1. Temperature
2. Velocity
3. Mass
4. Displacement

**Solution**:
To determine whether a quantity is a scalar or a vector, ask yourself: Does it have both magnitude and direction? If yes, it’s a vector; otherwise, it’s a scalar.

1. **Temperature**: Scalar  
   - Reason: Temperature has only magnitude (e.g., 25°C). It does not involve direction.
2. **Velocity**: Vector  
   - Reason: Velocity includes both magnitude (speed) and direction (e.g., 60 km/h north).
3. **Mass**: Scalar  
   - Reason: Mass is a measure of how much matter an object contains, with no direction (e.g., 5 kg).
4. **Displacement**: Vector  
   - Reason: Displacement involves both the distance traveled and the direction (e.g., 10 meters east).

## Example 2: Drawing a Vector

**Question**: Draw the vector representing "6 meters, 21° north of east."

**Solution**:
1. Start by identifying the direction:
   - "North of east" means the vector points slightly northward from the east direction.
   - The angle is measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis (east).
   - Therefore, the angle is $ 21^\circ $ above the horizontal axis.

2. Draw the vector:
   - Use a ruler to draw an arrow with a length proportional to 6 meters.
   - Ensure the arrow points at an angle of $ 21^\circ $ above the horizontal axis.

## Example 3: Determining Direction Using Bearings

**Question**: A ship sails on a bearing of N30°E. Determine the direction of the ship’s motion in terms of a true bearing.

**Solution**:
1. Understand the notation:
   - N30°E means "30 degrees east of north."
   - True bearings are measured clockwise from north.

2. Convert the quadrant bearing to a true bearing:
   - Starting from north (0°), move 30° clockwise toward the east.
   - The true bearing is $ 30^\circ $.

**Answer**: The ship’s true bearing is $ 30^\circ $.

## Example 4: Converting Bearings to Trigonometric Bearings

**Question**: Convert the quadrant bearing S45°W into a calculator-friendly trigonometric bearing.

**Solution**:
1. Understand the quadrant bearing:
   - S45°W means "45 degrees west of south."
   - In terms of angles, this is measured counterclockwise from the negative y-axis (south).

2. Calculate the trigonometric bearing:
   - Start at the positive x-axis (east).
   - Move $ 180^\circ $ to reach west.
   - Add $ 45^\circ $ counterclockwise to reach the final direction.
   - Total angle = $ 180^\circ + 45^\circ = 225^\circ $.

**Answer**: The trigonometric bearing is $ 225^\circ $.

## Example 5: Drawing a Vector Based on Speed and Bearing

**Question**: Draw the vector representing a velocity of 3 m/s^2, directed [N 40° W].

**Solution**:
1. Interpret the description:
   - "N" means the vector's direction can be found by starting towards NOrth and rotaing 40° towards the west.
   - The angle is measured clockwise from the positive y-axis (North).

2. Draw the vector:
   - Use a ruler to draw an arrow with a length proportional to 3 m/s^2.
   - Ensure the arrow points at an angle of $ 40^\circ $ clockwise from the  positive y-axis.
