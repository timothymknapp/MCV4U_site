# Lesson: Average Rate of Change

The **Average Rate of Change** of a function measures how the function's output value changes, on average, between two input values. This concept is analogous to finding the slope of the straight line (called the secant line) that connects two points on the function's graph.

## Formula

The formula for the average rate of change of a function \( f(x) \) between two points \( x = a \) and \( x = b \) is:

\[
\text{Average Rate of Change} = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}
\]

### Explanation of the Formula
- \( f(a) \): The value of the function at \( x = a \).
- \( f(b) \): The value of the function at \( x = b \).
- \( b - a \): The change in the input values.

This formula calculates the ratio of the change in the output (\( f(b) - f(a) \)) to the change in the input (\( b - a \)).

## Example

Suppose \( f(x) = x^2 \). Find the average rate of change of \( f(x) \) from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \).

### Solution
Using the formula:

\[
\text{Average Rate of Change} = \frac{f(3) - f(1)}{3 - 1}
\]

1. Calculate \( f(3) \) and \( f(1) \):
   - \( f(3) = 3^2 = 9 \)
   - \( f(1) = 1^2 = 1 \)

2. Substitute into the formula:
   \[
   \text{Average Rate of Change} = \frac{9 - 1}{3 - 1} = \frac{8}{2} = 4
   \]

Thus, the average rate of change of \( f(x) = x^2 \) from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \) is 4.

## Visual Interpretation

On the graph of \( f(x) = x^2 \), the average rate of change represents the slope of the straight line connecting the points \( (1, 1) \) and \( (3, 9) \).
