Welcome to Section 6.2, where we explore **vector addition**, a fundamental operation in mathematics and physics. Adding vectors allows us to combine multiple forces, velocities, or displacements into a single resultant vector. This process is essential for solving real-world problems involving motion, navigation, and forces.

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

### Learning Goal:
Understand how to add vectors geometrically and algebraically. Be able to represent vector addition with diagrams and solve simple vector addition problems.

### Success Criteria:
- Add vectors using the **head-to-tail method**.
- Add vectors using **components**.
- Interpret vector addition in real-world contexts.

## Key Idea: Combining Vectors
Vector addition combines two or more vectors to produce a **resultant vector**, which represents the total effect of all the individual vectors. 

Key properties of vector addition include:
- The **resultant vector** starts at the tail of the first vector and ends at the head of the last vector.
- Vector addition is **commutative**: $\vec{A} + \vec{B} = \vec{B} + \vec{A}$.

## Geometric Addition: Head-to-Tail Method
The **head-to-tail method** is a visual way to add vectors. Here’s how it works:
1. Place the tail of the second vector ($\vec{B}$) at the head of the first vector ($\vec{A}$).
2. Draw the resultant vector from the tail of $\vec{A}$ to the head of $\vec{B}$.

This method can result in one of three cases, depending on the relationship between the vectors.

## Three Cases of Vector Addition

### Case 1: Parallel or Anti-Parallel Vectors
When vectors lie along the same line (e.g., both due east or one east and one west):
- **Same direction**: Add their magnitudes.
- **Opposite directions**: Subtract the smaller magnitude from the larger.
- The direction of the resultant is determined by the larger vector.

### Case 2: Perpendicular Vectors
When vectors are perpendicular to each other (e.g., one east and one north), use:
- The **Pythagorean Theorem** to calculate the magnitude of the resultant.
- Basic trigonometry (e.g., tangent) to determine the direction.

### Case 3: Oblique Vectors
For vectors that are neither parallel nor perpendicular:
- Break each vector into its **x- and y-components**.
- Add the components separately to find the resultant vector.
- Use the Pythagorean Theorem and trigonometry to determine the magnitude and direction of the resultant.

## Visualizing Vector Addition
Let’s briefly visualize the three cases:

### Case 1: Parallel Vectors

### Case 2: Perpendicular Vectors

*Figure: Adding two perpendicular vectors forms a right triangle, where the resultant is the hypotenuse.*

### Case 3: Oblique Vectors

## Why Does This Matter?
Vector addition is not just a theoretical concept—it has countless practical applications:
- Engineers use it to analyze forces acting on structures.
- Pilots and navigators rely on it to plot efficient flight paths.
- Physicists apply it to model motion and interactions in space.

By mastering vector addition, you’ll gain a powerful tool for solving complex problems in science, engineering, and everyday life.
