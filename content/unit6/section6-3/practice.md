1. When a vector is multiplied by a positive scalar ($k > 0$), its magnitude is scaled by $|k|$, and its direction remains unchanged.
   - Magnitude of the new vector:
     
     $$
     |\vec{v}_{\text{new}}| = |k| \cdot |\vec{v}| = 3 \cdot 5 = 15~\text{units}.
     $$

2. The direction of the vector remains due east.

**Answer**:  
The new vector has a magnitude of $ \boxed{15~\text{units [E]}} $.

1. When a vector is multiplied by a negative scalar ($k < 0$), its magnitude is scaled by $|k|$, and its direction is reversed.
   - Magnitude of the new vector:
 
     $$
     |\vec{u}_{\text{new}}| = |k| \cdot |\vec{u}| = |-2| \cdot 8 = 16~\text{units}.
     $$

2. The direction of the vector is reversed from north to south.

**Answer**:  
The new vector has a magnitude of $ \boxed{16~\text{units [S]}} $.

#### Ex3.
Two vectors are given: $\vec{a} = 4~\text{units [E]}$ and $\vec{b} = 3~\text{units [N]}$. Find the resultant vector if both vectors are scaled by a factor of $2$ and then added together.

<details>

    <strong id="solution-title">Solution</strong>
  </summary>

1. Scale each vector by $2$:
   - For $\vec{a}$:
 
     $$
     \vec{a}_{\text{scaled}} = 2 \cdot \vec{a} = 2 \cdot 4 = 8~\text{units [E]}.
     $$
 
   - For $\vec{b}$:
 
     $$
     \vec{b}_{\text{scaled}} = 2 \cdot \vec{b} = 2 \cdot 3 = 6~\text{units [N]}.
     $$

2. Add the scaled vectors using the Pythagorean theorem:
   - Magnitude of the resultant:
 
     $$
     R = \sqrt{|\vec{a}_{\text{scaled}}|^2 + |\vec{b}_{\text{scaled}}|^2} = \sqrt{(8)^2 + (6)^2} = \sqrt{64 + 36} = \sqrt{100} = 10~\text{units}.
     $$

3. Use trigonometry to find the direction. Let $\theta$ be the angle north of east:
 
   $$
   \tan\theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{6}{8}.
   $$
 
   $$
   \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{6}{8}\right) \approx 36.9^\circ.
   $$

**Answer**:  
The resultant vector has a magnitude of $ \boxed{10~\text{units [36.9Â° N of E]}} $.

#### Ex4.
A car is traveling at a velocity of $20~\text{m/s [W]}$. If the driver accelerates and doubles the car's speed, what is the new velocity vector?

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong id="solution-title">Solution</strong>
  </summary>

1. Doubling the speed corresponds to multiplying the velocity vector by a scalar of $2$:
   - Magnitude of the new velocity:
 
     $$
     |\vec{v}_{\text{new}}| = |k| \cdot |\vec{v}| = 2 \cdot 20 = 40~\text{m/s}.
     $$

2. The direction of the velocity remains due west.

**Answer**:  
The new velocity vector is $ \boxed{40~\text{m/s [W]}} $.
