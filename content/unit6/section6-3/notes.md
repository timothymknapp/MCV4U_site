In this section, we’ll work through additional example problems that reinforce the concepts of scalar multiplication. These examples use different numbers and contexts to help you practice scaling vectors geometrically.

## Example 1: Scaling a Vector by a Fraction

A vector $\vec{v}$ has a magnitude of 12 units and points due north. Find the new vector if it is scaled by a factor of $ \frac{1}{3} $.

**Solution**:  
When a vector is multiplied by a positive scalar ($k > 0$), its magnitude is scaled by $|k|$, and its direction remains unchanged.  
- Magnitude of the new vector:
 
  $$
  |\vec{v}_{\text{new}}| = |k| \cdot |\vec{v}| = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 12 = 4~\text{units}.
  $$

The direction of the vector remains due north.  

**Answer**:  
The new vector has a magnitude of $ \boxed{4~\text{units [N]}} $.

## Example 2: Reversing and Stretching a Vector

A vector $\vec{u}$ has a magnitude of 9 units and points due west. Find the new vector if it is scaled by a factor of $-4$.

**Solution**:  
When a vector is multiplied by a negative scalar ($k < 0$), its magnitude is scaled by $|k|$, and its direction is reversed.  
- Magnitude of the new vector:
 
  $$
  |\vec{u}_{\text{new}}| = |k| \cdot |\vec{u}| = |-4| \cdot 9 = 36~\text{units}.
  $$

The direction of the vector is reversed from west to east.  

**Answer**:  
The new vector has a magnitude of $ \boxed{36~\text{units [E]}} $.

## Example 3: Combining Scalar Multiplication with Addition

Two vectors are given: $\vec{a} = 6~\text{units [E]}$ and $\vec{b} = 8~\text{units [S]}$. Find the resultant vector if both vectors are scaled by a factor of $0.5$ and then added together.

**Solution**:  
1. Scale each vector by $0.5$:  
   - For $\vec{a}$:
 
     $$
     \vec{a}_{\text{scaled}} = 0.5 \cdot \vec{a} = 0.5 \cdot 6 = 3~\text{units [E]}.
     $$
 
   - For $\vec{b}$:
 
     $$
     \vec{b}_{\text{scaled}} = 0.5 \cdot \vec{b} = 0.5 \cdot 8 = 4~\text{units [S]}.
     $$

2. Add the scaled vectors using the Pythagorean theorem:  
   - Magnitude of the resultant:
 
     $$
     R = \sqrt{|\vec{a}_{\text{scaled}}|^2 + |\vec{b}_{\text{scaled}}|^2} = \sqrt{(3)^2 + (4)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5~\text{units}.
     $$

3. Use trigonometry to find the direction. Let $\theta$ be the angle south of east:
 
   $$
   \tan\theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{4}{3}.
   $$
 
   $$
   \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{4}{3}\right) \approx 53.1^\circ.
   $$

**Answer**:  
The resultant vector has a magnitude of $ \boxed{5~\text{units [53.1° S of E]}} $.

## Example 4: Interpreting Scalar Multiplication in Context

A boat is traveling at a velocity of $15~\text{m/s [N]}$. If the boat slows down to half its original speed, what is the new velocity vector?

**Solution**:  
Slowing down to half the speed corresponds to multiplying the velocity vector by a scalar of $0.5$:  
- Magnitude of the new velocity:
 
  $$
  |\vec{v}_{\text{new}}| = |k| \cdot |\vec{v}| = 0.5 \cdot 15 = 7.5~\text{m/s}.
  $$

The direction of the velocity remains due north.  

**Answer**:  
The new velocity vector is $ \boxed{7.5~\text{m/s [N]}} $.

## Example 5: Scaling a Vector in an Oblique Direction

A vector $\vec{w}$ has a magnitude of 10 units and points $30^\circ$ north of east. Find the new vector if it is scaled by a factor of $-2$.

**Solution**:  
1. When a vector is multiplied by a negative scalar ($k < 0$), its magnitude is scaled by $|k|$, and its direction is reversed.  
   - Magnitude of the new vector:
 
     $$
     |\vec{w}_{\text{new}}| = |k| \cdot |\vec{w}| = |-2| \cdot 10 = 20~\text{units}.
     $$

2. The direction is reversed. Since the original vector points $30^\circ$ north of east, the reversed vector will point $30^\circ$ south of west.  

**Answer**:  
The new vector has a magnitude of $ \boxed{20~\text{units [30° S of W]}} $.
