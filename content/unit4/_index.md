Welcome to an exploration of **Curve Sketching** in MCV4U! This unit will equip you with powerful tools to analyze and visualize the behavior of functions. By understanding how derivatives reveal critical information about a function's shape, you'll be able to construct accurate and insightful graphs.

## Learning Objectives

In this unit, we’ll focus on two essential techniques:
1. **The First Derivative Test**:  
   - Understand how the sign of the first derivative determines whether a function is increasing or decreasing.
   - Identify **critical points** (where $ f'(x) = 0 $ or $ f'(x) $ is undefined) and classify them as local maxima, minima, or neither.

2. **The Second Derivative Test**:  
   - Explore how the second derivative reveals **concavity**—whether the graph is curving upward ($ f''(x) > 0 $) or downward ($ f''(x) < 0 $).
   - Locate **inflection points**, where the concavity changes.

Using these tools, you’ll gain a systematic approach to sketching curves that capture all key features of a function, including:
- Intercepts (x- and y-intercepts)
- Asymptotes (vertical, horizontal, and oblique)
- Intervals of increase and decrease
- Local extrema
- Concavity and inflection points

## Types of Functions We’ll Study

We’ll apply these techniques to a variety of function families, including:
- **Rational Functions**: Analyze asymptotic behavior and sharp turns.
- **Power Functions**: Understand symmetry and end behavior.
- **Trigonometric Functions**: Capture periodicity and oscillations.
- **Exponential and Logarithmic Functions**: Investigate rapid growth or decay.
- **Simple Compositions of Functions**: Combine different function types to model more complex behaviors.

## Why Curve Sketching Matters

Curve sketching is more than just drawing graphs—it’s about developing a deep understanding of how mathematical functions behave. These skills are foundational for fields like physics, engineering, economics, and data science, where visualizing relationships between variables is crucial.

By the end of this unit, you’ll be able to confidently analyze and sketch the graphs of a wide range of functions, combining analytical rigor with creative problem-solving.
