## Ex 1: 

Analyzing the Graph of \( y = e^{-x-3} \) Using First and Second Derivative Tests


## Step 1: Find the First Derivative

To find the first derivative \( y' \) of \( y = e^{-x-3} \), we differentiate directly with respect to \( x \):

\[
y = e^{-x-3}
\]

The derivative of \( e^{u} \) where \( u = -x - 3 \) is \( e^u \cdot \frac{du}{dx} \). Here, \( \frac{du}{dx} = -1 \), so:

\[
y' = e^{-x-3} \cdot (-1)
\]

Thus, the first derivative is:

\[
y' = -e^{-x-3}
\]

## Step 2: Find the Critical Points

Critical points occur where \( y' = 0 \) or \( y' \) is undefined. Let's set \( y' = 0 \):

\[
-e^{-x-3} = 0
\]

Since \( e^{-x-3} \) is never zero for any real value of \( x \), there are no critical points for this function.

## Step 3: Find the Second Derivative

Next, we find the second derivative \( y'' \) to check the concavity.

Start with the first derivative:

\[
y' = -e^{-x-3}
\]

Differentiate again with respect to \( x \):

\[
y'' = -\frac{d}{dx} \left( e^{-x-3} \right)
\]

Using the chain rule:

\[
y'' = -e^{-x-3} \cdot (-1) = e^{-x-3}
\]

Thus, the second derivative is:

\[
y'' = e^{-x-3}
\]

## Step 4: Analyze the Behavior of the Function

- **First derivative test**: Since there are no critical points (the first derivative is never zero), the function does not have local maxima or minima. The function is always decreasing because the first derivative \( y' = -e^{-x-3} \) is always negative for all real values of \( x \).
- **Second derivative test**: The second derivative \( y'' = e^{-x-3} \) is always positive because the exponential function is always positive for all \( x \). This indicates that the function is concave up (convex) everywhere.

## Step 5: Sketch the Graph

From our analysis:

- The function \( y = e^{-x-3} \) is always decreasing for all real values of \( x \).
- The function approaches 0 as \( x \to \infty \), and it increases without bound as \( x \to -\infty \).
- The graph is asymptotic to the horizontal line \( y = 0 \) for large \( x \).

### Graph Sketch

We can conclude that the graph of \( y = e^{-x-3} \) is a decreasing curve that approaches 0 as \( x \to \infty \) and grows without bound as \( x \to -\infty \). It has no local maxima or minima, and it is concave up everywhere.

The derivative of \( e^{u} \) where \( u = -x - 3 \) is \( e^u \cdot \frac{du}{dx} \). Here, \( \frac{du}{dx} = -1 \), so:

\]

Thus, the first derivative is:

\[
y' = -e^{-x-3}
\]

## Step 2: Find the Critical Points

Critical points occur where \( y' = 0 \) or \( y' \) is undefined. Let's set \( y' = 0 \):

\[
-e^{-x-3} = 0
\]

Since \( e^{-x-3} \) is never zero for any real value of \( x \), there are no critical points for this function.

## Ex 3:  

Analyzing the Graph of \( y = 3\sin(2x) - \cos(2x) \) Using First and Second Derivative Tests (Domain: \( -2\pi \leq x \leq 2\pi \))

## Step 1: Find the First Derivative

To find the first derivative \( y' \) of \( y = 3\sin(2x) - \cos(2x) \), we differentiate directly with respect to \( x \):

\[
y = 3\sin(2x) - \cos(2x)
\]

Differentiating term by term:

\[
y' = 3 \cdot \frac{d}{dx}(\sin(2x)) - \frac{d}{dx}(\cos(2x))
\]

Using the chain rule for both terms:

\[
y' = 3 \cdot 2\cos(2x) - (-2\sin(2x))
\]

\[
y' = 6\cos(2x) + 2\sin(2x)
\]

Thus, the first derivative is:

\[
y' = 6\cos(2x) + 2\sin(2x)
\]

## Step 2: Find the Critical Points

Critical points occur where \( y' = 0 \) or \( y' \) is undefined. Let's set \( y' = 0 \):

\[
6\cos(2x) + 2\sin(2x) = 0
\]

Simplify by dividing through by 2:

\[
3\cos(2x) + \sin(2x) = 0
\]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[
\sin(2x) = -3\cos(2x)
\]

Divide both sides by \( \cos(2x) \) (assuming \( \cos(2x) \neq 0 \)):

\[
\tan(2x) = -3
\]

To solve for \( x \), we take the inverse tangent:

\[
2x = \tan^{-1}(-3)
\]

\[
x = \frac{1}{2} \tan^{-1}(-3)
\]

Since the tangent function is periodic with a period of \( \pi \), the general solution for \( x \) is:

\[
x = \frac{1}{2} \left( \tan^{-1}(-3) + n\pi \right), \quad n \in \mathbb{Z}
\]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( \tan^{-1}(-3) \), which is approximately \( -1.249 \) radians. Therefore, the critical points are:

\[
x = \frac{1}{2} \left( -1.249 + n\pi \right), \quad n \in \mathbb{Z}
\]

For the interval \( x \in [-2\pi, 2\pi] \), the critical points are:

- For \( n = 0 \), \( x = \frac{-1.249}{2} \approx -0.624 \)
- For \( n = 1 \), \( x = \frac{-1.249 + \pi}{2} \approx 1.947 \)
- For \( n = -1 \), \( x = \frac{-1.249 - \pi}{2} \approx -2.946 \)

So, the critical points in the interval \( x \in [-2\pi, 2\pi] \) are approximately \( x = -2.946, -0.624, 1.947 \).

## Step 3: Find the Second Derivative

Next, we find the second derivative \( y'' \) to check the concavity.

Start with the first derivative:

\[
y' = 6\cos(2x) + 2\sin(2x)
\]

Differentiate again with respect to \( x \):

\[
y'' = 6 \cdot \frac{d}{dx}(\cos(2x)) + 2 \cdot \frac{d}{dx}(\sin(2x))
\]

Using the chain rule:

\[
y'' = 6 \cdot (-2\sin(2x)) + 2 \cdot 2\cos(2x)
\]

\[
y'' = -12\sin(2x) + 4\cos(2x)
\]

Thus, the second derivative is:

\[
y'' = -12\sin(2x) + 4\cos(2x)
\]

## Step 4: Analyze the Critical Points

We now use the second derivative to classify the critical points:

- For \( x = -2.946 \):

\[
y''(-2.946) = -12\sin(2 \times -2.946) + 4\cos(2 \times -2.946) \approx -12(0.168) + 4(-0.986) \approx -2.016 - 3.944 \approx -5.96
\]

Since \( y'' < 0 \), the function is concave down at \( x = -2.946 \), so this is a local maximum.

- For \( x = -0.624 \):

\[
y''(-0.624) = -12\sin(2 \times -0.624) + 4\cos(2 \times -0.624) \approx -12(-0.992) + 4(0.125) \approx 11.904 + 0.5 \approx 12.404
\]

Since \( y'' > 0 \), the function is concave up at \( x = -0.624 \), so this is a local minimum.

- For \( x = 1.947 \):

\[
y''(1.947) = -12\sin(2 \times 1.947) + 4\cos(2 \times 1.947) \approx -12(0.868) + 4(-0.497) \approx -10.416 - 1.988 \approx -12.404
\]

Since \( y'' < 0 \), the function is concave down at \( x = 1.947 \), so this is a local maximum.

## Step 5: Sketch the Graph

From our analysis:

- The function has a local maximum at \( x \approx -2.946 \) and \( x \approx 1.947 \).
- The function has a local minimum at \( x \approx -0.624 \).
- The function is periodic with a period of \( \pi \), as indicated by the sine and cosine functions.
- The graph will oscillate between local maxima and minima as \( x \) moves between \( -2\pi \) and \( 2\pi \).

### Graph Sketch

We can conclude that the graph of \( y = 3\sin(2x) - \cos(2x) \) on the interval \( x \in [-2\pi, 2\pi] \) will show periodic oscillations with alternating local maxima and minima.

## Ex 4:

Analyzing the Graph of \( y = xe^x \) Using First and Second Derivative Tests

Let's analyze and sketch the graph of \( y = xe^x \) by first finding the first and second derivatives, then using these tests to understand the function's behavior.

## Step 1: Find the First Derivative

To find the first derivative \( y' \) of \( y = xe^x \), we use the product rule. The product rule states that \( \frac{d}{dx}(uv) = u'v + uv' \), where \( u = x \) and \( v = e^x \).

Differentiating \( y = xe^x \):

\[
y' = \frac{d}{dx}(x) \cdot e^x + x \cdot \frac{d}{dx}(e^x)
\]

\[
y' = e^x + xe^x
\]

Thus, the first derivative is:

\[
y' = e^x + xe^x
\]

## Step 2: Find the Critical Points

Critical points occur where \( y' = 0 \) or \( y' \) is undefined. Let's set \( y' = 0 \):

\[
e^x + xe^x = 0
\]

Factor out \( e^x \):

\[
e^x(1 + x) = 0
\]

Since \( e^x \) is never zero for any real \( x \), we have:

\[
1 + x = 0
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = -1
\]

So, the only critical point is \( x = -1 \).

## Step 3: Find the Second Derivative

Next, we find the second derivative \( y'' \) to check the concavity.

Start with the first derivative:

\[
y' = e^x + xe^x
\]

Differentiate again with respect to \( x \):

\[
y'' = \frac{d}{dx}(e^x) + \frac{d}{dx}(xe^x)
\]

Using the product rule for \( xe^x \):

\[
y'' = e^x + \left(e^x + xe^x\right)
\]

\[
y'' = e^x + e^x + xe^x = 2e^x + xe^x
\]

Thus, the second derivative is:

\[
y'' = 2e^x + xe^x
\]

## Step 4: Analyze the Critical Point

Now we use the second derivative to classify the critical point at \( x = -1 \):

\[
y''(-1) = 2e^{-1} + (-1)e^{-1} = 2e^{-1} - e^{-1} = e^{-1}
\]

Since \( e^{-1} > 0 \), the function is concave up at \( x = -1 \), and therefore, \( x = -1 \) is a local minimum.

## Step 5: Sketch the Graph

From our analysis:

- The function has a local minimum at \( x = -1 \).
- The function is increasing for \( x > -1 \) and decreasing for \( x < -1 \).
- As \( x \to \infty \), the function increases without bound, and as \( x \to -\infty \), the function approaches zero because \( xe^x \to 0 \) as \( x \to -\infty \).

### Graph Sketch

We can conclude that the graph of \( y = xe^x \) will have:

- A local minimum at \( x = -1 \).
- The function increases for \( x > -1 \) and decreases for \( x < -1 \).
- The graph approaches zero as \( x \to -\infty \) and increases without bound as \( x \to \infty \).
