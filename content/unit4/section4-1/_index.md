# The First Derivative Test

## Understanding Maximums and Minimums

In this section, we’ll explore one of the most powerful tools in calculus for analyzing the behavior of functions: **the First Derivative Test**. This test allows us to identify and classify **local maximums** and **local minimums**—key points where a function reaches its highest or lowest values within a specific interval.

### What Are Maximums and Minimums?

- A **local maximum** occurs at a point where the function changes from increasing to decreasing. At this point, the value of the function is higher than all nearby points.
- A **local minimum** occurs where the function changes from decreasing to increasing. Here, the value of the function is lower than all nearby points.

These critical points are essential for understanding the overall shape of a function's graph and have applications in optimization problems across fields like physics, economics, biology, and engineering.

### The Role of the First Derivative

The first derivative, $ f'(x) $, provides crucial information about the behavior of a function:
- When $ f'(x) > 0 $, the function is **increasing**.
- When $ f'(x) < 0 $, the function is **decreasing**.
- When $ f'(x) = 0 $ or $ f'(x) $ is undefined, we’ve found a **critical point**, which could potentially be a local maximum, local minimum, or neither.

By analyzing how the sign of $ f'(x) $ changes around these critical points, we can determine whether they correspond to a maximum, minimum, or something else entirely.

### Why Is This Important?

The ability to locate and classify maximums and minimums is fundamental to many real-world applications:
- In business, it helps optimize profits or minimize costs.
- In physics, it can determine the highest point of a projectile’s trajectory or the equilibrium position of a system.
- In engineering, it aids in designing efficient systems with optimal parameters.

### What You’ll Learn in This Section

In this section, we’ll focus on:
1. Identifying **critical points** by solving $ f'(x) = 0 $ or finding where $ f'(x) $ is undefined.
2. Using the **First Derivative Test** to analyze the sign changes of $ f'(x) $ around critical points.
3. Classifying critical points as **local maxima**, **local minima**, or neither based on the behavior of $ f'(x) $.

This foundational knowledge will prepare you to tackle more complex problems in curve sketching and optimization.
