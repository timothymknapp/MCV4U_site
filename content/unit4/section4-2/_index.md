## Understanding How Functions Behave

One of the most fundamental aspects of analyzing a function is understanding where it is **increasing** or **decreasing**. These behaviors give us insight into the overall shape of the graph and help us identify key features such as peaks, valleys, and transitions.

### What Does It Mean for a Function to Increase or Decrease?

- A function is said to be **increasing** on an interval if, as $ x $ increases, the value of $ f(x) $ also increases. Visually, this means the graph rises as you move from left to right.
- Conversely, a function is **decreasing** on an interval if, as $ x $ increases, the value of $ f(x) $ decreases. Here, the graph falls as you move from left to right.

These changes in direction are not arbitrary—they occur at specific points called **critical points**, which play a pivotal role in determining the behavior of the function.

### The Role of Critical Points

Critical points are locations where the derivative $ f'(x) $ is either **zero** or **undefined**. These points mark potential transitions in the behavior of the function:
- At a critical point, the function may switch from increasing to decreasing, or vice versa.
- Between critical points, the function maintains a consistent trend—it is either entirely increasing or entirely decreasing.

This means that the intervals of increase and decrease are determined by analyzing the sign of $ f'(x) $ on each subinterval defined by the critical points.

### Why Is This Important?

Understanding where a function is increasing or decreasing allows us to:
- Identify regions of growth or decline in real-world applications, such as population dynamics, economic trends, or motion analysis.
- Locate turning points, which are essential for sketching accurate graphs and solving optimization problems.
- Build a deeper intuition for how functions behave and interact with their inputs.

### Key Takeaways for This Section

In this section, we’ll focus on:
1. Defining **increasing** and **decreasing** intervals based on the sign of $ f'(x) $.
2. Identifying **critical points** as the only locations where the behavior of the function can change.
3. Using the derivative to determine the trend of the function on intervals between critical points.

By mastering these concepts, you’ll gain a powerful tool for analyzing and interpreting the behavior of functions—a cornerstone of calculus and its applications.
