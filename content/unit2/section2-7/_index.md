### Overview
In this section, we delve into the concept of tangent lines and their equations, which are fundamental to understanding the behavior of functions at specific points. The equation of a tangent line provides a linear approximation of a function near a given point, enabling us to analyze rates of change and local behavior effectively. We will explore how to find the equation of a tangent line using the point-slope form of a linear equation and discuss the process of identifying the x-values where a function has a particular slope.

By the end of this section, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of tangent lines and their significance in calculus.

### Key Concepts

#### 1. **The Point-Slope Form of a Linear Equation**
The point-slope form is a standard representation of a line's equation:
\[
y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)
\]
where:
- \(m\) is the slope of the line.
- \((x_1, y_1)\) is a point through which the line passes.

In the context of tangent lines, the slope \(m\) corresponds to the derivative of the function \(f(x)\) evaluated at a specific point \(x = c\). Thus, the slope of the tangent line at \(x = c\) is given by:
\[
m = f'(c)
\]

#### 2. **Finding the Equation of a Tangent Line**
To determine the equation of a tangent line to a curve \(y = f(x)\) at a point \(x = c\), follow these steps:
1. Compute the derivative \(f'(x)\), which represents the instantaneous rate of change of \(f(x)\).
2. Evaluate \(f'(c)\) to find the slope \(m\) of the tangent line at \(x = c\).
3. Determine the coordinates of the point of tangency: \((c, f(c))\).
4. Substitute \(m\), \(x_1 = c\), and \(y_1 = f(c)\) into the point-slope form to obtain the equation of the tangent line.

#### 3. **Identifying x-Values with a Specific Slope**
To locate the x-values where a function \(f(x)\) has a particular slope \(m\), solve the equation:
\[
f'(x) = m
\]
This involves:
1. Computing the derivative \(f'(x)\).
2. Setting \(f'(x) = m\) and solving for \(x\).
3. Verifying the solutions to ensure they lie within the domain of \(f(x)\).

### Theoretical Foundations

#### Derivative as Slope
The derivative \(f'(x)\) measures the instantaneous rate of change of \(f(x)\) at any point \(x\). Geometrically, this corresponds to the slope of the tangent line to the curve \(y = f(x)\) at that point. By leveraging the derivative, we can precisely define and compute tangent lines for differentiable functions.

#### Tangent Line Approximation
The tangent line serves as a local linear approximation of the function near the point of tangency. This approximation is particularly useful in applications such as optimization, error estimation, and numerical methods.

#### Solving for Specific Slopes
Finding the x-values where a function has a given slope involves solving an equation derived from the derivative. This process highlights the relationship between the algebraic properties of the derivative and the geometric behavior of the function.
