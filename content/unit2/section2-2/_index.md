## 2.2 Sum and Difference Rules

### Overview

In this section, we will explore the **Sum Rule** and **Difference Rule**, two fundamental rules in differentiation that allow us to differentiate the sum and difference of functions. These rules are essential tools in calculus for breaking down more complex functions into simpler components, making differentiation easier and more systematic.

### Sum Rule

The **Sum Rule** states that the derivative of the sum of two functions is the sum of the derivatives of each function. Mathematically, if \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) are differentiable functions, then:

\[
\frac{d}{dx}[f(x) + g(x)] = f'(x) + g'(x)
\]

This rule simplifies the differentiation of functions that are the sum of two or more terms.

#### Example of the Sum Rule:

For \( f(x) = x^3 + x^2 \), the derivative is:
\[
f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}[x^3] + \frac{d}{dx}[x^2] = 3x^2 + 2x
\]

### Difference Rule

The **Difference Rule** is similar to the Sum Rule but applies when the function is the difference of two functions. If \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) are differentiable, then:

\[
\frac{d}{dx}[f(x) - g(x)] = f'(x) - g'(x)
\]

#### Example of the Difference Rule:

For \( f(x) = x^3 - 2x \), the derivative is:
\[
f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}[x^3] - \frac{d}{dx}[2x] = 3x^2 - 2
\]

### Applying Both Rules

If a function is a combination of both sums and differences, you apply both rules in sequence. For example, for the function \( f(x) = x^2 + 3x - 4 \), we use both rules:

1. Apply the Sum Rule to the first two terms:
   \[
   \frac{d}{dx}[x^2 + 3x] = 2x + 3
   \]
2. Apply the Difference Rule to subtract the constant term:
   \[
   \frac{d}{dx}[4] = 0
   \]
   
Thus, the derivative of \( f(x) = x^2 + 3x - 4 \) is:
\[
f'(x) = 2x + 3
\]

### Summary

- The **Sum Rule** and **Difference Rule** make it easy to differentiate functions that involve the addition or subtraction of terms.
- Both rules work by differentiating each term individually and then combining the results.
- These rules help simplify the process of finding derivatives of polynomial and rational functions, especially when multiple terms are involved.

In this section, we will focus on using the Sum and Difference Rules to differentiate functions involving polynomials and rational expressions. The key takeaway is that these rules allow us to break down complex functions into simpler, differentiable components.
