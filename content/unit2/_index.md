## Unit: Derivative Rules

### Overview
In this unit, students will build upon the foundational concepts of rates of change and the derivative introduced in Unit 1. They will explore the core rules for computing derivatives, including the power rule, sum and difference rules, product and quotient rules, and the chain rule. These tools will enable students to efficiently differentiate a variety of functions, primarily focusing on polynomials and rational functions.

### Key Derivative Rules
The derivative rules provide systematic techniques for finding derivatives without resorting to the limit definition each time. These include:

1. **Power Rule**:  
   For \( f(x) = x^n \), where \( n \) is any real number:  
   $$f'(x) = n \cdot x^{n-1}$$

2. **Sum and Difference Rules**:  
   For \( f(x) = g(x) + h(x) \) or \( f(x) = g(x) - h(x) \):  
   $$f'(x) = g'(x) + h'(x) \quad \text{or} \quad f'(x) = g'(x) - h'(x)$$

3. **Product Rule**:  
   For \( f(x) = g(x) \cdot h(x) \):  
   $$f'(x) = g'(x)h(x) + g(x)h'(x)$$

4. **Quotient Rule**:  
   For \( f(x) = \frac{g(x)}{h(x)} \), where \( h(x) \neq 0 \):  
   $$f'(x) = \frac{g'(x)h(x) - g(x)h'(x)}{h(x)^2}$$

5. **Chain Rule**:  
   For a composite function \( f(x) = g(h(x)) \):  
   $$f'(x) = g'(h(x)) \cdot h'(x)$$

### Focus on Function Types
This unit will focus on differentiating polynomials and rational functions, ensuring students master the derivative rules in preparation for more complex functions like trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions (covered in Unit 3).

- **Polynomials**: Functions like \( f(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 7x - 5 \).  
- **Rational Functions**: Functions like \( f(x) = \frac{x^2 + 3x + 1}{x - 2} \).

### Applying Derivatives
Students will learn how to use derivative rules to solve real-world problems involving rates of change, tangents, and optimization. These skills are essential for analyzing and modeling various phenomena.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this unit, students will:
1. Master the power, sum, difference, product, quotient, and chain rules for differentiation.  
2. Differentiate polynomials and rational functions with confidence.  
3. Apply derivative rules to solve problems involving rates of change and tangents.  
4. Develop a strong foundation for tackling more advanced functions in Unit 3.
