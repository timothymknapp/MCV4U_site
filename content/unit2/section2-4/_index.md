### Overview
In this section, we will learn how to differentiate functions that are expressed as a quotient, or ratio, of two functions. The quotient rule is an essential tool in calculus that allows us to compute the derivative of a function in the form:

\[
f(x) = \frac{u(x)}{v(x)}
\]

where both \( u(x) \) and \( v(x) \) are differentiable functions of \( x \). This rule is particularly useful when dealing with rational functions, where one function is divided by another.

### The Quotient Rule

The quotient rule states that if \( f(x) = \frac{u(x)}{v(x)} \), then the derivative of \( f(x) \) is:

\[
f'(x) = \frac{v(x) \cdot u'(x) - u(x) \cdot v'(x)}{[v(x)]^2}
\]

Where:
- \( u'(x) \) is the derivative of the numerator \( u(x) \),
- \( v'(x) \) is the derivative of the denominator \( v(x) \),
- and \( [v(x)]^2 \) is the square of the denominator.

### When to Use the Quotient Rule
The quotient rule should be applied when differentiating expressions that involve one function divided by another. It is especially useful when the quotient cannot be simplified easily, as attempting to do so may lead to unnecessary complexity. 

### Example

For example, if we have:

\[
f(x) = \frac{x^2 + 1}{x - 3}
\]

We would differentiate it using the quotient rule. The numerator is \( u(x) = x^2 + 1 \) and the denominator is \( v(x) = x - 3 \), so we would compute their derivatives and apply the formula.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, students will:
1. Be able to apply the quotient rule to differentiate rational functions.
2. Understand the relationship between the quotient rule and the product rule.
3. Be familiar with simplifying the results after applying the quotient rule.
