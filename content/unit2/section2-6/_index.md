### Overview

In the previous section, we explored the **Chain Rule**, a powerful tool for differentiating composite functions. Now, in this section, we take our understanding of derivatives to the next level by combining multiple derivative rules—such as the Power Rule, Product Rule, Quotient Rule, and Chain Rule—to tackle more complex problems. This is where calculus becomes truly versatile, allowing us to differentiate almost any function we encounter.

By the end of this section, you will be able to confidently apply various derivative rules together, ensuring that no matter how intricate the function, you’ll know exactly how to proceed.

### Why Mix the Derivative Rules?

Real-world problems often involve functions that combine multiple mathematical operations, such as multiplication, division, exponentiation, and composition. For example:
- A product of two functions where one is a composite function.
- A quotient involving trigonometric or exponential functions.
- Polynomials raised to powers or nested within other functions.

To handle these scenarios, we need to seamlessly integrate the derivative rules we’ve learned so far. Mastering this skill will give you the confidence to solve a wide range of calculus problems.

### Key Concepts and Strategies

1. **Identify the Structure of the Function**: Before applying any derivative rule, analyze the function carefully. Determine whether it involves products, quotients, powers, or compositions.
   
2. **Apply the Appropriate Rule**:
   - Use the **Power Rule** for simple powers.
   - Use the **Product Rule** for products of two functions.
   - Use the **Quotient Rule** for ratios of two functions.
   - Use the **Chain Rule** for composite functions.

3. **Combine Rules When Necessary**: If a function requires multiple rules, work step-by-step. For instance:
   - Differentiate the outermost operation first.
   - Then move inward, applying additional rules as needed.

4. **Simplify Your Answer**: After computing the derivative, simplify your result to make it easier to interpret.

### Example: Combining Multiple Rules

Let’s consider a function that requires mixing several derivative rules:
\[
f(x) = \frac{(x^2 + 1)^3}{e^{2x}}
\]

#### Step 1: Recognize the Structure
This is a quotient of two functions:
- The numerator is \( u(x) = (x^2 + 1)^3 \), which involves the Chain Rule.
- The denominator is \( v(x) = e^{2x} \), which involves the Chain Rule as well.

#### Step 2: Apply the Quotient Rule
The Quotient Rule states:
\[
\frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{u}{v}\right) = \frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}
\]

#### Step 3: Differentiate Each Component
- For \( u(x) = (x^2 + 1)^3 \):
  - Outer function: \( w^3 \), where \( w = x^2 + 1 \).
  - Inner function: \( x^2 + 1 \).
  - Using the Chain Rule:
    \[
    u'(x) = 3(x^2 + 1)^2 \cdot 2x = 6x(x^2 + 1)^2
    \]

- For \( v(x) = e^{2x} \):
  - Using the Chain Rule:
    \[
    v'(x) = e^{2x} \cdot 2 = 2e^{2x}
    \]

#### Step 4: Substitute into the Quotient Rule
\[
f'(x) = \frac{\big(6x(x^2 + 1)^2\big)e^{2x} - (x^2 + 1)^3 \cdot 2e^{2x}}{\big(e^{2x}\big)^2}
\]

#### Step 5: Simplify
Factor out common terms and simplify further:
\[
f'(x) = \frac{e^{2x} \big[6x(x^2 + 1)^2 - 2(x^2 + 1)^3\big]}{e^{4x}}
\]
\[
f'(x) = \frac{6x(x^2 + 1)^2 - 2(x^2 + 1)^3}{e^{2x}}
\]
