### Overview
In this section, we extend our understanding of tangent lines to include transcendental functions such as exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions. These functions are widely used in science, engineering, and economics, making their analysis crucial. We will explore how to compute derivatives of these functions and use them to find the equations of tangent lines at specific points.

By the end of this section, you will be able to apply the concepts of derivatives and tangent lines to transcendental functions, deepening your understanding of their behavior and applications.

### Key Concepts

#### 1. **Transcendental Functions and Their Derivatives**
Transcendental functions include:
- Exponential functions: \( f(x) = e^x \) or \( f(x) = a^x \)
- Logarithmic functions: \( f(x) = \ln(x) \) or \( f(x) = \log_a(x) \)
- Trigonometric functions: \( f(x) = \sin(x), \cos(x), \tan(x), \) etc.

The derivatives of these functions are:
- \( \frac{d}{dx}[e^x] = e^x \)
- \( \frac{d}{dx}[a^x] = a^x \ln(a) \)
- \( \frac{d}{dx}[\ln(x)] = \frac{1}{x} \)
- \( \frac{d}{dx}[\log_a(x)] = \frac{1}{x \ln(a)} \)
- \( \frac{d}{dx}[\sin(x)] = \cos(x) \)
- \( \frac{d}{dx}[\cos(x)] = -\sin(x) \)
- \( \frac{d}{dx}[\tan(x)] = \sec^2(x) \)

#### 2. **Finding the Equation of a Tangent Line**
To determine the equation of a tangent line to a transcendental function \( y = f(x) \) at a point \( x = c \):
1. Compute the derivative \( f'(x) \).
2. Evaluate \( f'(c) \) to find the slope \( m \) of the tangent line.
3. Determine the coordinates of the point of tangency: \( (c, f(c)) \).
4. Use the point-slope form of a line: \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \).

#### Example: Tangent Line to \( f(x) = e^x \) at \( x = 0 \)
1. Compute the derivative: \( f'(x) = e^x \).
2. Evaluate at \( x = 0 \): \( f'(0) = e^0 = 1 \). So, \( m = 1 \).
3. Find the point of tangency: \( f(0) = e^0 = 1 \). Thus, the point is \( (0, 1) \).
4. Write the equation of the tangent line:
   \[
   y - 1 = 1(x - 0) \implies y = x + 1
   \]

#### 3. **Identifying x-Values with a Specific Slope**
To locate the x-values where a transcendental function \( f(x) \) has a particular slope \( m \):
1. Compute the derivative \( f'(x) \).
2. Solve the equation \( f'(x) = m \).
3. Verify the solutions to ensure they lie within the domain of \( f(x) \).

#### Example: Finding x-Values Where \( f(x) = \sin(x) \) Has Slope \( m = 0 \)
1. Compute the derivative: \( f'(x) = \cos(x) \).
2. Solve \( \cos(x) = 0 \): \( x = \frac{\pi}{2} + n\pi \), where \( n \) is an integer.
3. Verify the solutions: These values are valid since \( \cos(x) = 0 \) occurs periodically.

### Theoretical Foundations

#### Derivative as Slope for Transcendental Functions
The derivative of a transcendental function provides the instantaneous rate of change at any point \( x \). This slope corresponds to the steepness of the tangent line to the curve at that point.

#### Tangent Line Approximation for Transcendental Functions
The tangent line serves as a local linear approximation of the function near the point of tangency. For transcendental functions, this approximation is particularly useful in modeling real-world phenomena, such as population growth (exponential functions) or oscillatory motion (trigonometric functions).

#### Solving for Specific Slopes in Transcendental Functions
Finding the x-values where a transcendental function has a given slope involves solving equations derived from its derivative. This process often requires knowledge of trigonometric identities, logarithmic properties, or exponential rules.
