## Basic Derivative Rules

Before diving into logarithmic derivatives, let's recall some basic derivative rules:
- The derivative of a constant is zero: \( \frac{d}{dx}[c] = 0 \)
- The power rule: \( \frac{d}{dx}[x^n] = n x^{n-1} \)
- The chain rule: \( \frac{d}{dx}[f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x) \)

## Derivative of the Natural Logarithm

The derivative of the natural logarithm \( \ln(x) \) is one of the most fundamental results in calculus:

\[
\frac{d}{dx}[\ln(x)] = \frac{1}{x}, \quad x > 0
\]

### Proof of the Derivative of \( \ln(x) \)

To prove that the derivative of \( \ln(x) \) is \( \frac{1}{x} \), we use the **limit definition of the derivative**:

\[
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
\]

For \( f(x) = \ln(x) \), this becomes:

\[
\frac{d}{dx}[\ln(x)] = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\ln(x+h) - \ln(x)}{h}
\]

#### Step 1: Simplify using the properties of logarithms
Using the property of logarithms \( \ln(a) - \ln(b) = \ln\left(\frac{a}{b}\right) \), we can rewrite the numerator:

\[
\frac{d}{dx}[\ln(x)] = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\ln\left(\frac{x+h}{x}\right)}{h}
\]

Simplify the argument of the logarithm:

\[
\frac{d}{dx}[\ln(x)] = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\ln\left(1 + \frac{h}{x}\right)}{h}
\]

#### Step 2: Use the small-angle approximation for logarithms
For small values of \( h \), we can approximate \( \ln(1 + u) \approx u \). Let \( u = \frac{h}{x} \). Then:

\[
\ln\left(1 + \frac{h}{x}\right) \approx \frac{h}{x}
\]

Substitute this approximation into the limit:

\[
\frac{d}{dx}[\ln(x)] = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\frac{h}{x}}{h}
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{d}{dx}[\ln(x)] = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{1}{x}
\]

Since \( \frac{1}{x} \) does not depend on \( h \), the limit evaluates to:

\[
\frac{d}{dx}[\ln(x)] = \frac{1}{x}
\]

---

## Conclusion

We have proven that the derivative of \( \ln(x) \) is \( \frac{1}{x} \). This result is fundamental in calculus and is widely used in various applications.

\[
\boxed{\frac{d}{dx}[\ln(x)] = \frac{1}{x}}
\]

## Derivative of General Logarithmic Functions

For a general logarithmic function \( \log_a(x) \), where \( a > 0 \) and \( a \neq 1 \), the derivative is given by:

\[
\frac{d}{dx}[\log_a(x)] = \frac{1}{x \ln(a)}
\]

### Proof of the Derivative of \( \log_a(x) \)

To derive this result, we use the relationship between logarithmic functions and the natural logarithm. Recall that:

\[
\log_a(x) = \frac{\ln(x)}{\ln(a)}
\]

Now, differentiate \( \log_a(x) \) with respect to \( x \):

\[
\frac{d}{dx}[\log_a(x)] = \frac{d}{dx}\left[\frac{\ln(x)}{\ln(a)}\right]
\]

Since \( \ln(a) \) is a constant, we can factor it out:

\[
\frac{d}{dx}[\log_a(x)] = \frac{1}{\ln(a)} \cdot \frac{d}{dx}[\ln(x)]
\]

From the derivative of \( \ln(x) \), we know:

\[
\frac{d}{dx}[\ln(x)] = \frac{1}{x}
\]

Substitute this result back into the equation:

\[
\frac{d}{dx}[\log_a(x)] = \frac{1}{\ln(a)} \cdot \frac{1}{x}
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{d}{dx}[\log_a(x)] = \frac{1}{x \ln(a)}
\]

---

## Conclusion

We have derived the formula for the derivative of a general logarithmic function \( \log_a(x) \), which is \( \frac{1}{x \ln(a)} \). This result extends the concept of logarithmic differentiation beyond the natural base \( e \).

\[
\boxed{\frac{d}{dx}[\log_a(x)] = \frac{1}{x \ln(a)}}
\]
