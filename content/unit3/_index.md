## Unit 3: Derivatives of Transcendental Functions
### Overview
In this unit, students will extend their understanding of derivatives to transcendental functions, including trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions. These functions arise naturally in many real-world applications, such as modeling periodic phenomena, growth and decay processes, and logarithmic scales. Building upon the derivative rules introduced in Unit 2, students will learn how to compute derivatives of these more complex functions and apply them to solve practical problems.

### Key Concepts
This unit will cover the following key topics:
1. **Derivatives of Trigonometric Functions**:  
   Students will learn the derivatives of sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant, along with their proofs.
   
2. **The Number \( e \) and the Natural Logarithm \( \ln(x) \)**:  
   An introduction to the mathematical constant \( e \), its significance, and the natural logarithm function \( \ln(x) \). Essential properties of exponential and logarithmic functions will also be reviewed.

3. **Derivatives of Exponential Functions**:  
   Students will explore the unique property of the exponential function \( e^x \) being its own derivative, as well as the derivatives of general exponential functions \( a^x \).

4. **Derivatives of Logarithmic Functions**:  
   The derivative of the natural logarithm \( \ln(x) \) and general logarithmic functions \( \log_a(x) \) will be derived and applied.

### Focus on Function Types
This unit will focus on differentiating transcendental functions, ensuring students understand their unique properties and how they interact with derivative rules:
- **Trigonometric Functions**: Functions like \( f(x) = \sin(x) \), \( f(x) = \cos(x) \), and \( f(x) = \tan(x) \).
- **Exponential Functions**: Functions like \( f(x) = e^x \) and \( f(x) = a^x \).
- **Logarithmic Functions**: Functions like \( f(x) = \ln(x) \) and \( f(x) = \log_a(x) \).

### Applying Derivatives
Students will apply the derivative rules for transcendental functions to solve real-world problems involving rates of change, tangents, optimization, and modeling. These skills are essential for analyzing and solving problems in physics, engineering, economics, and other fields.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this unit, students will:
1. Understand the significance of the number \( e \) and the natural logarithm \( \ln(x) \), and their roles in calculus.
2. Master the derivatives of trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions.
3. Apply derivative rules to transcendental functions with confidence.
4. Solve practical problems involving rates of change, tangents, and optimization for transcendental functions.
5. Develop a deeper appreciation for the applications of calculus in modeling real-world phenomena.

### Prerequisites
Before starting this unit, students should have a solid understanding of:
- Basic derivative rules (power rule, sum/difference rules, product rule, quotient rule, chain rule).
- Differentiation of polynomials and rational functions.
- Properties of exponential and logarithmic functions (reviewed in Section 3.0).
