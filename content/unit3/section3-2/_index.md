## The Number \( e \)

The number \( e \) is one of the most important constants in mathematics, often referred to as **Euler's number**. It is an irrational number approximately equal to:

\[
e \approx 2.71828
\]

### Definition of \( e \)

The number \( e \) can be defined in several ways:
1. **Limit Definition**: \( e \) is the limit of the sequence \( \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n \) as \( n \to \infty \):

   \[
   e = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n
   \]

2. **Series Definition**: \( e \) can also be expressed as an infinite series:

   \[
   e = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n!} = 1 + \frac{1}{1!} + \frac{1}{2!} + \frac{1}{3!} + \cdots
   \]

### Why is \( e \) Important?

The number \( e \) arises naturally in many areas of mathematics, physics, and engineering. Some key reasons include:
- The function \( e^x \) is its own derivative, making it fundamental in calculus.
- \( e^x \) is used to model exponential growth and decay.
- \( e \) appears in compound interest formulas, population growth models, and radioactive decay.

## The Natural Logarithm \( \ln(x) \)

The natural logarithm, denoted \( \ln(x) \), is the logarithm with base \( e \). It is defined as the inverse of the exponential function \( e^x \):

\[
y = \ln(x) \quad \text{if and only if} \quad e^y = x, \quad x > 0
\]

### Properties of \( \ln(x) \)

1. \( \ln(e) = 1 \)
2. \( \ln(1) = 0 \)
3. \( \ln(ab) = \ln(a) + \ln(b) \), for \( a, b > 0 \)
4. \( \ln\left(\frac{a}{b}\right) = \ln(a) - \ln(b) \), for \( a, b > 0 \)
5. \( \ln(a^b) = b \ln(a) \), for \( a > 0 \)

## Review of Exponential and Logarithmic Rules

Here is a quick review of the essential rules of exponents and logarithms that will be useful in the upcoming sections on derivatives.

### Exponential Rules

1. \( a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n} \)
2. \( \frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n} \), for \( a \neq 0 \)
3. \( (a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n} \)
4. \( a^0 = 1 \), for \( a \neq 0 \)
5. \( e^{\ln(x)} = x \), for \( x > 0 \)

### Logarithmic Rules

1. \( \log_a(xy) = \log_a(x) + \log_a(y) \), for \( x, y > 0 \)
2. \( \log_a\left(\frac{x}{y}\right) = \log_a(x) - \log_a(y) \), for \( x, y > 0 \)
3. \( \log_a(x^b) = b \log_a(x) \), for \( x > 0 \)
4. \( \log_a(a) = 1 \)
5. \( \log_a(1) = 0 \)
6. \( \ln(e^x) = x \)

In this section, we introduced the mathematical constant \( e \), the natural logarithm \( \ln(x) \), and reviewed key properties of exponential and logarithmic functions. Understanding these concepts is crucial for studying the derivatives of exponential and logarithmic functions in the next sections. Move on to Section 3.2 to explore the derivatives of exponential functions.
